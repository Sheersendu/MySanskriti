<summary>üìå Redis Eviction Policy</summary>

By default, Redis won't evict anything unless it‚Äôs configured to do so. Run Redis Docker (everytime!) with:

```
docker run -d --name my-redis -p 6379:6379 redis

1. go into redis-cli ( terminal )
redis-cli

2. setting maxmemory and eviction policy
CONFIG SET maxmemory 100mb
CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

3. verifying eviction policy
CONFIG GET maxmemory
CONFIG GET maxmemory-policy

Explanation:
- maxmemory 100mb: Limits Redis to 100 MB.
- maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru: Enables LRU eviction across all keys.
```

<summary>üìå Step-by-Step Stripe Payment Flow (ChatGPT)</summary>

1. User initiates payment (Frontend)

    The user clicks a ‚ÄúPay‚Äù or ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button.

    This triggers a call to your backend API to create a Stripe Checkout session.

‚úÖ Why backend?

    Sensitive data like product price, currency, and Stripe secret keys must not be exposed in frontend.

    You may want to validate the cart, compute price, apply discounts, and save a pending order in DB before payment.

2. Backend calls Stripe API to create a Checkout session

   Your backend (Node, .NET, Python, etc.) calls Stripe using your secret key to create a session.

   You specify:

        Products (name, price, quantity)

        Payment method

        Success/cancel URLs

        Optionally customer details (name, email, etc.)

        (in India) Address and name for export compliance

   Stripe returns a session URL, which you send back to the frontend.


3. Frontend redirects user to Stripe‚Äôs hosted checkout page

   The frontend uses window.location.href = session.url to redirect.

   Stripe handles card input, UPI, and all sensitive payment processing on its secure page.

‚úÖ You don‚Äôt touch any card data, avoiding PCI compliance issues.
4. Stripe processes the payment

   If payment succeeds, the user is redirected to the success_url.

   If cancelled, Stripe redirects to the cancel_url.

üö´ ‚ö†Ô∏è At this point, you cannot trust that a payment succeeded just because the user landed on success_url.
5. Stripe triggers a webhook to your backend

   Stripe sends a POST request to your backend webhook endpoint.

   This includes the official record of payment status (e.g., payment_intent.succeeded, checkout.session.completed).

‚úÖ Your backend verifies the webhook signature and processes:

    Mark the order as paid in DB

    Send email confirmation

    Allocate inventory or grant access

6. You respond to the webhook

   Your webhook handler returns HTTP 200 to Stripe.

   This ensures Stripe won‚Äôt retry sending the event.

Local : Listen to Stripe webhooks using the Stripe CLI
```
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:5269/api/payment/webhook-endpoint
```
